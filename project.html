These services offer various amounts of free storage to consumers and they all offer more storage based on a tiered system with prices increasing with storage amount. Security is a feature mentioned by all the competition.</p>

          <p class="wide">With the user research done, it was time to take out the notebook and start sketching. I wanted to create something simple and easy to use with the focus on user content. I made a few iterations of wireframe sketches and wireframe mockups.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="wide">Using the wireframe mockups, I created a clickable prototype on InVision. I conducted user tests via video chat and in person. I had the users show me how they would sign up for an account, add content to the account, and organize their content.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="wide bottom-margin">From the usability tests, I learned that I should include a drag and drop feature for moving content around and to make sure icons are recognizable. With the testing in mind, I made some alterations to the layout before moving on.</p>

            <h3>Building the Brand</h3>
            <p>In order to add style to this project I needed to create the brand. First, I researched how the competition brands their products and began brainstorming. Many cloud storage brands use blue as a primary color and clouds in some way. I decided to skip the blue but keep the clouds.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I created many variations of the logo and a list of ideas for a name. I eventually came up with the name Sky Saves and chose a cloud behind three trees as the logo. The trees are meant to be upload arrows and represent the companies environmentally friendly stance.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="bottom-margin">I put some of these ideas onto a moodboard for inspiration. Using this moodboard as a guideline, I started focusing on details such as fonts and colors. I took these decisions and created a style guide for the website.</p>

          <h3 class="sky-align">Mockups</h3>
          <p class="bottom-margin wide">The next step was exciting because I got to take everything from the previous steps and put it all together. My goal was to make a very minimal website. Once I had my first iteration of mockups, I conducted user preference tests. After the tests, I made some alterations and went through a few iterations until I was satisfied.</p>

          <h3 class="sky-align">Prototype</h3>
          <p class="center bottom-margin wide">After building the mockups, I created a clickable prototype of the website. I conducted a few more usability tests to see how people interacted with the website and if they could complete some basic tasks. The results were very positive. From this round of testing I learned I should add a signup button to the bottom of the home page and to make sure the uploading bar is visible.</p>

          <h3 class="sky-align">Conclusion</h3>
          <p class="wide">I’m really happy with the outcome of this project. It evolved more than I thought it would but I’m glad that it did. My original idea for differentiation from the competition was to make something more attractive but when working on the branding I realized I could do a lot more. I’m satisfied with the minimal looking home page and user dashboard and I really like the eco-friendly branding.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="wide">I learned a lot from working on this. On my next project, I’ll sketch out a larger variety of layouts early on. I think I’ll also test out more colors on wireframes too.</p>
