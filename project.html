        <h3>User Survey</h3>
        <p>I conducted a user survey to learn more about potential users.</p>
        <p>Which cloud storage service do you prefer?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Google Drive 71.4%</li>
          <li>iCloud 21.4%</li>

          <li>Upload/ download content</li>
          <li>Organization of content</li>
          <li>Sharing content</li>

        </ul>
        <p>What (about cloud storage) would you improve if you could?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Free storage!</li>
          <li>Security</li>

        <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
        <p>The competition I researched was Google Drive, Dropbox, and Apple iCloud. All three competitors offer separate personal and business accounts. These services offer various amounts of free storage to consumers and they all offer more storage based on a tiered system with prices increasing with storage amount. Security is a feature mentioned by all the competition.</p>

        <h3>User Personas</h3>
        <p>Now that I had a feel for the competition and important features, I created user personas to represent the target market. The main users I discovered during the market research phase were students and professionals.</p>

        <h3>User stories</h3>
        <p>Using all the previous research, I compiled a list of the most important tasks that users should be able to accomplish with this service. This was an important step to help avoid scope creep.</p>

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>With the user research done, it was time to take out the notebook and start sketching. I wanted to create something simple and easy to use with the focus on user content. I made a few iterations of wireframe sketches and wireframe mockups.</p>
        <p>Using the wireframe mockups, I created a clickable prototype on InVision. I conducted user tests via video chat and in person. I had the users show me how they would sign up for an account, add content to the account, and organize their content.</p>
        <p>From the usability tests, I learned that I should include a drag and drop feature for moving content around and to make sure icons are recognizable. With the testing in mind, I made some alterations to the layout before moving on.</p>

        <h3>Building the Brand</h3>
        <p>In order to add style to this project I needed to create the brand. First, I researched how the competition brands their products and began brainstorming. Many cloud storage brands use blue as a primary color and clouds in some way. I decided to skip the blue but keep the clouds.</p>
        <p>I created many variations of the logo and a list of ideas for a name. I eventually came up with the name Sky Saves and chose a cloud behind three trees as the logo. The trees are meant to be upload arrows and represent the companies environmentally friendly stance.</p>
        <p>I put some of these ideas onto a moodboard for inspiration. Using this moodboard as a guideline, I started focusing on details such as fonts and colors. I took these decisions and created a style guide for the website.</p>

        <h3>Mockups</h3>
        <p>The next step was exciting because I got to take everything from the previous steps and put it all together. My goal was to make a very minimal website. Once I had my first iteration of mockups, I conducted user preference tests. After the tests, I made some alterations and went through a few iterations until I was satisfied.</p>

        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <p>After building the mockups, I created a clickable prototype of the website. I conducted a few more usability tests to see how people interacted with the website and if they could complete some basic tasks. The results were very positive. From this round of testing I learned I should add a signup button to the bottom of the home page and to make sure the uploading bar is visible.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>I’m really happy with the outcome of this project. It evolved more than I thought it would but I’m glad that it did. My original idea for differentiation from the competition was to make something more attractive but when working on the branding I realized I could do a lot more. I’m satisfied with the minimal looking home page and user dashboard and I really like the eco-friendly branding.</p>
        <p>I learned a lot from working on this. On my next project, I’ll sketch out a larger variety of layouts early on. I think I’ll also test out more colors on wireframes too.</p>
